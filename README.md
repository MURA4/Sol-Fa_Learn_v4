# 🎼 Sol-Fa Learn — Android App for Music Theory & Ear Training

A practical mobile app built during **Samsung Innovation Campus** to help musicians master solfège (music fundamentals) through interactive exercises, a built-in piano, and real-time feedback.

## 🎯 What it does
- **Interactive solfège trainer**: Practice note recognition, intervals, and scales  
- **On-screen piano**: Play and hear notes in real time  
- **Ear training drills**: Identify melodies, rhythms, and chords by ear  
- **Community chat**: Discuss music theory with other learners via **Firebase Realtime Database**  
- **Progress tracking**: Save results and monitor improvement over time

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Platform**: Android (Java)  
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Realtime Database, Cloud Messaging)  
- **UI/UX**: Custom piano keyboard, responsive layouts, audio feedback  
- **Tools**: Android Studio, Git

## 💡 Why I built it
As a former music student, I know how hard solfège can be. I wanted to create a **mobile-first, gamified tool** that makes music theory **accessible, engaging, and social** — especially for self-learners.

This project taught me how to:
- Design user-centric mobile experiences  
- Integrate real-time features with Firebase  
- Handle audio input/output on Android  
- Ship a full-featured app from idea to prototype
